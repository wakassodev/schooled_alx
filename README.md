- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).



## Key Concepts

### 1. Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML is crucial for creating a meaningful and well-structured document. In this project, we leverage semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` to enhance the document's structure. Each element is used appropriately to convey the purpose of different sections.

### 2. Responsive Design

To ensure a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes, the project incorporates responsive design principles. The `<meta>` viewport tag is set, and media queries are employed in the CSS (`css/styles.css`) to adjust styles based on the device's characteristics.

### 3. Forms and Input Elements

Forms play a crucial role in user interaction. The project demonstrates the use of HTML `<form>` elements along with various input types, such as text inputs, checkboxes, and radio buttons. Proper labeling and accessibility attributes are included to enhance usability.

### 4. Embedded Content

Embedded content, such as images and videos, is effectively utilized. The `images/` directory contains example images, and the `<img>` element is used with appropriate attributes. Additionally, the `<video>` element is employed to embed a sample video.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/wakassodev/alx_html_css.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser or deploy the project on a web server for testing.
3. Explore the document structure, responsiveness, and various HTML elements used.
